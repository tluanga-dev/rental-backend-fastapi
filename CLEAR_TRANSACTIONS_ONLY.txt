To clear ONLY transaction headers and transaction lines (preserving inventory data):

Method 1 - Single command:
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d fastapi_db -c "BEGIN; DELETE FROM rental_return_lines; DELETE FROM rental_returns; DELETE FROM rental_return_events; DELETE FROM rental_lifecycles; DELETE FROM transaction_metadata; DELETE FROM transaction_lines; DELETE FROM transaction_headers; COMMIT;"

Method 2 - Using SQL file:
docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d fastapi_db < scripts/clear_transactions_only.sql

Method 3 - Interactive:
1. Connect to database:
   docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d fastapi_db

2. Run these commands:
   BEGIN;
   DELETE FROM rental_return_lines;
   DELETE FROM rental_returns;
   DELETE FROM rental_return_events;
   DELETE FROM rental_lifecycles;
   DELETE FROM transaction_metadata;
   DELETE FROM transaction_lines;
   DELETE FROM transaction_headers;
   COMMIT;

3. Verify transaction data is cleared:
   SELECT 'transaction_headers' as table, COUNT(*) FROM transaction_headers
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'transaction_lines', COUNT(*) FROM transaction_lines;

4. Verify inventory data is preserved:
   SELECT 'inventory_units' as table, COUNT(*) FROM inventory_units
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'stock_levels', COUNT(*) FROM stock_levels;

5. Exit:
   \q

This will clear:
- All transaction headers
- All transaction lines
- All rental returns and related data
- All transaction metadata

This will preserve:
- Inventory units
- Stock levels
- Stock movements
- Item master data
- Customer data
- Supplier data
