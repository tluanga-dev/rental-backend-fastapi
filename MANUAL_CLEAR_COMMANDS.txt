To clear all inventory and transaction data, run these commands:

1. First, access your PostgreSQL database:

docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d fastapi_db

2. Once in the PostgreSQL prompt, copy and paste this entire block:

BEGIN;
DELETE FROM inspection_reports;
DELETE FROM rental_return_lines;
DELETE FROM rental_returns;
DELETE FROM rental_return_events;
DELETE FROM rental_lifecycles;
DELETE FROM transaction_metadata;
DELETE FROM transaction_lines;
DELETE FROM transaction_headers;
DELETE FROM stock_movements;
DELETE FROM stock_levels;
DELETE FROM inventory_units;
COMMIT;

3. To verify the data has been cleared, run:

SELECT 
    'transaction_headers' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM transaction_headers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'transaction_lines', COUNT(*) FROM transaction_lines
UNION ALL
SELECT 'inventory_units', COUNT(*) FROM inventory_units
UNION ALL
SELECT 'stock_levels', COUNT(*) FROM stock_levels
UNION ALL
SELECT 'stock_movements', COUNT(*) FROM stock_movements;

4. Exit PostgreSQL:

\q

Alternative single-line command (run from terminal):

docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d fastapi_db -c "BEGIN; DELETE FROM inspection_reports; DELETE FROM rental_return_lines; DELETE FROM rental_returns; DELETE FROM rental_return_events; DELETE FROM rental_lifecycles; DELETE FROM transaction_metadata; DELETE FROM transaction_lines; DELETE FROM transaction_headers; DELETE FROM stock_movements; DELETE FROM stock_levels; DELETE FROM inventory_units; COMMIT;"

To check if data was cleared:

docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d fastapi_db -c "SELECT 'transaction_headers' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM transaction_headers UNION ALL SELECT 'transaction_lines', COUNT(*) FROM transaction_lines UNION ALL SELECT 'inventory_units', COUNT(*) FROM inventory_units UNION ALL SELECT 'stock_levels', COUNT(*) FROM stock_levels;"
